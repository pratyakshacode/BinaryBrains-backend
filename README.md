## To Setup The Project we need to follow some steps
- Clone the repository
- Run npm install in the root folder to download all the dependencies.
- There are two terminals needed for two different commands.
- - "npm run watch" to create the dist folder
  - "npm start" to start the server
- Server will be running on PORT 3000 by default. We can set the port in .ENV file

There is one dummy router, middleware and controller provided to check that how we will be proceeding.
